## Installation Instructions

### Chrome (and Other Chromium-Based Browsers)

1. Clone or download this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download.git
    ```
   Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. Open Chrome (or your Chromium-based browser) and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.

3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner.

4. Select the option to "Load unpacked" and choose the folder where the repository is cloned or extracted.

**Note:** These steps are very similar for other Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge, Brave, or Opera. You may just need to navigate to the corresponding extensions page (e.g., `edge://extensions/` for Edge). Depending on the browser, the buttons may be located elsewhere on the page. If you see the message `Unrecognized manifest key 'browser_specific_settings'`, you can safely ignore it. This key is only used by Firefox and has no effect on Chrome or other Chromium-based browsers.


### Firefox

1. Clone or download this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/phawdk/studydrive-download.git
    ```
   Or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. Open Firefox and navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.

3. Click on "Load Temporary Add-on" and select the `manifest.json` file from the repository folder.

**Note:**  This temporary Firefox add-on will last until the browser is closed.
